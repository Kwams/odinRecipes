    <h3>The Excellent Blueberry Smoothie</h3>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>33g (1 scoop) protein powder of choice</li>
        <li>45g (¼ serving) frozen blueberries</li>
        <li>1g (¼ tsp) guar/xanthan gum</li>
        <li>90ml (⅜ cup) unsweetened almond milk</li>
        <li>Ice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add all ingredients to a blender. Blend for 1 minute on medium￾high speed until there is a smooth consistency. Note that if you use casein protein, the shake will be thicker.</li>
        <li>Scrape sides of the blender and ensure all ingredients are blended. You may have to pulse the blender a few times depending on the consistency you want to achieve. You can always add more ice or almond milk to get the consistency you desire.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture out of the blender and into a mug to consume immediately. You may drizzle with powdered peanut butter, fresh blueberries, or Walden Farms low-calorie syrup.</li>
    </ol>
